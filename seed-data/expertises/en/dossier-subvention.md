intro: >-
  The primary goal of grant-making organizations is to stimulate the music
  economy by keeping funds flowing. More fundamentally, these financial
  supports aim to encourage artistic creation while strengthening sustainable
  employment for artists. Any aid requested should therefore bolster the budget
  and, in turn, enrich the project's implementation.

<!-- section:start -->

> The aim of a grant application is to present a faithful and honest reflection of the project: all elements must be mentioned, including any other assistance requested. Don't forget that organizations communicate with each other and cross-check information.

### **Respect collective agreements**

For a music project, the funding body will want to know how many artists and technicians are involved, and how and to what extent they are remunerated.
The employment of professional artists implies the payment of salaries, social security contributions and minimum remuneration set by legislation.
This is where collective agreements come into play.

> A collective agreement is an official document setting out the working conditions and wages specific to each professional sector. There are hundreds of such agreements. It is therefore crucial to consult the collective bargaining agreement for your field of activity to find out the minimum wage and specific working conditions applicable.

For example, if you are a record company employing musicians and technicians to record an album in the studio, you will need to refer to the collective agreement for **phonographic publishing**.

If you are planning to organize a concert in a rental venue, we recommend that you consult the collective agreement **for companies in the private live performance sector** to check the minimum wages to be declared.

### **Drawing up a budget estimate and estimating the amount of assistance**

The purpose of a provisional budget is to set out in figures the expansion strategy for a project. It is not necessary for professionals to go through biographies or artistic descriptions to judge the feasibility of a project. A budget analysis is often all that's needed, as it provides a clearer picture of future expenditure.

> In a budget forecast, professionals seek to assess the consistency between projected project development costs and anticipated revenues.

The amount of financial assistance is determined **BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSES**.

Please note that a collective management organization will NEVER subsidize a budget in its entirety. The financial assistance granted will only cover a portion of the expenses, hence the need to provide a perfectly adjusted budget in order to apply for the maximum amount.

<!-- section:end -->
<!-- section:start -->

### **Gather administrative and promotional documents and supporting evidence**

All invoices and estimates, dated and signed, must be submitted:

- All dated and signed invoices and quotations
- proof that contributions to certain organizations have been paid (URSAFF or AUDIENS certificate)
- Distribution or licensing contracts, as well as recording contracts
- Pay slips for intermittent workers
- Artist biographies/project descriptions
- All promotional documents: press kit, media plan (i.e. press promotion strategy and objectives), future concert and/or tour dates, etc.
- Don't hesitate to write a production memo explaining point by point the nature of all your expenses.

<!-- section:end -->
<!-- section:start -->

### **Managing your grant application strategically**

> The more economically and commercially your project is developed, the greater your chances of obtaining financial support.

Prepare a retro-planning for each request for assistance:

- Create an online client/member space
- Anticipate the submission of works/registrations
- Prepare the application
- Collect documents and supporting evidence
- Draw up the provisional budget
- Submit application
- Keep to the commission schedule
- Anticipate the project's release date based on the organization's response date
- Anticipate payment of grant (or advance)
- Prepare additional documents to be sent (invoices, supporting documents, etc.).
