Dark Beats fuses Ugly Mac Beer's raw urban energy with Yann Kornowicz's cinematic touch. The result is a sharp, nocturnal soundtrack driven by rugged drums, dark synths and stylized tension.

From shadowy atmospheres to pulsing grooves, this album brings together two creative universes to energize bold visuals, high-impact editing and neon-bathed stories. Dark, elegant and irresistibly modern.
