Modern minimalism with jazz flavors and subtle percussion. 17 cinematic tracks for human dramas, art, documentaries, films, historical subjects and more, composed and performed by Laurent Dury, award-winning French composer.

This album features underscore versions, short formats for advertising as well as all stems. It stands as the worthy successor to Minimal Stories (PGO022) and Minimal Stories Vol.2 (PGO040).
