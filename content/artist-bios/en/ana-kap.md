Ana Kap is an atypical trio from Caen that brings jazz, Balkan music and a guinguette spirit into playful conversation, with boundless imagination. Their music recalls the time when jazz was both fun and popular: virtuosic yet light, made as much for dancing as for listening. Trumpet, accordion and violin explore their colours like a sonic rainbow, somewhere between a smoky jazz cellar, a riverside ball on the Marne and echoes of Eastern European brass bands.
The group plays only original compositions, drawing as much from Nino Rota's film scores and Astor Piazzolla's world as from Dave Douglas's albums Charms of the Night Sky and A Thousand Evenings. Their finely crafted writing always leaves plenty of room for improvisation, creating a joyful sense of urgency that takes the listener from laughter to tears in just a few bars.
With its "mischievous-sonic" universe, Ana Kap offers music that is both sensitive and festive, accessible to young and old ears alike—so long as they are curious. A trio with real character, capable of turning every concert into the soundtrack of an imaginary film, where poetry, swing and the freedom of improvisation play the leading roles.
