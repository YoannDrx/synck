The son of two violinists, he was raised on classical music and spent five years at the conservatory studying violin. His two uncles, both composers, fed him John Adams, Steve Reich, Lutosławski, Philip Glass and the whole contemporary scene of the late 20th century. As a teenager, he discovered that music for picture draws on all these influences at once and fell in love with that playground. Self-taught, he mainly writes genre music that references specific eras. It is never pastiche, though: his artistic aim is to twist these influences—weathered by time—into a kind of musical alternate history on the edge of hauntology, with a clear preference for dark atmospheres. Over the years he has turned professional and, alongside his own albums, has composed music for documentaries, commercials, exhibitions and production music, while also working as an artistic director on numerous film shoots. He now runs his own production and recording studio near Paris Saint-Lazare: Silvercut Studio.
