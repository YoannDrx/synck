dDamage is a French electronic duo formed in Paris by brothers Jean-Baptiste and Frédéric Hanak in the late 1990s. Their hybrid sound, at the crossroads of hip-hop, electro, rock, breakcore and noise, makes them one of the most distinctive projects on the French electronic scene. Over roughly twenty years of activity, dDamage released a dense discography – including the albums Radio Ape, Brother in Death and several original soundtracks – and played nearly 600 shows around the world, building a reputation as a band that is just as radical on record as it is on stage. The duo multiplied collaborations with key figures from rap and the international underground (La Caution, TTC, MF DOOM, Mike Ladd, Dose One, among others), strengthening their image as an unbridled sonic laboratory. The dDamage adventure came to an abrupt end in 2018 with the passing of Frédéric Hanak, leaving behind a cult catalogue – a vital itch in French electronic music that never stopped experimenting or challenging the rules.
