Emmanuel Marée is a versatile French drummer and composer whose career is driven by curiosity and a love of blending genres. Trained in jazz classes at the Conservatoire, he built a solid technical foundation before moving to New York to further his musical journey on the local scene. After returning to Paris several years later, Emmanuel broadened his musical language far beyond jazz: exploring electronic music, musical theatre (notably Hair), pop-folk with Hugh Coltman and Ndidi O, indie pop with Robi, and French chanson alongside Benoît Carré and Alexandre Kinn. Drummer for the rock band My Friend Jeff and for singer Zanarelli (with whom he contributed to Christophe's final album), Emmanuel Marée multiplies collaborations both in the studio and on stage. Constantly seeking new horizons, he joined the stage project "Georges", a tribute to the Canetti-era repertoire – from Brassens to Brel via Vian and Gainsbourg – for around twenty dates. This show allowed him to revisit iconic songs from the 1950s and to bring together his many influences in a fresh reinterpretation of the French chanson heritage. Moving between jazz, rock, electronic music and chanson, Emmanuel Marée stands out as a chameleonic musician, serving each project through both his drumming and his sense of co-composition.
