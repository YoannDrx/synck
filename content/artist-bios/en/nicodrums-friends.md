Nicodrum & Friends is the project of percussionist and multi-instrumentalist Nicodrum, focused on Jamaican music, reggae, dub and traditional percussion. The project brings together various guests around warm, organic compositions. Since the 2000s, Nicodrum has confirmed his deep commitment to Nyabinghi and Burru rhythms, ritual patterns that are part of the Rastafari movement. Through live collaborations and studio sessions, he has contributed to albums by internationally acclaimed artists such as Touré Kunda, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Richie Spice, Queen Omega, Jah Mason, Pressure, Willie Williams, as well as French artists like Taïro, Blacko and Mo’Kalamity. Above all, it is thanks to Skully who, on each visit to France, takes the time to call Nicodrum and work with him for hours on the drums — at the hotel, backstage with the “Jamaica All Stars”. With over 15 years of studio and live experience, this passionate percussionist composed Back to Fundehchan!, a 12-track album recorded and mixed at Wise Studio by the talented Fabwize (Jamaica All Stars, Black Roots, Clinton Fearon…) exclusively on analog gear, using plenty of vintage effects for a sound that is both roots and powerful. The title of the album speaks for itself to those in the know. Nyabinghi is traditionally played on the original Aketeh percussion set, which consists of three different drums: the bass drum, the fundeh and the repeater. The fundeh provides the rhythmic reference, laying down the basic pulse — the foundation — hence the play on words Back to Fundehchan!
