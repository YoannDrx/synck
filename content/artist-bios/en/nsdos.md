Born in 1984 in Paris, NSDOS, aka Kirikoo Des, is a French multidisciplinary artist. After studying at the Académie Internationale de la Danse (AID), he felt the urge to create sounds to move to, driven by a desire to invent a new sonic order. Sometimes described by the French press as a “techno hacker”, he hijacks technological tools to connect machines and matter. He collects living data using sensors placed on his body while he dances, interactive devices, or innovative coding programs, then injects this data into the straight backbone of techno to create an organic matrix. He invites the audience to push with him the limits of bodies, objects and sounds. Constantly seeking new formats to develop his art, he involves the public in his performances, workshops and masterclasses, held in contemporary art museums or at digital art events such as MUTEK Mexico, Montreal and Tokyo, the BIAN in Montreal, the Gwangju Biennale in South Korea, and the Milan Triennale.
