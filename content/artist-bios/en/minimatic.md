Pascal Houpert, professionally known as MINIMATIC, is a French artist renowned for his unique take on musical retro-modernism. He began his career at the age of 14 as a rock drummer, then quickly branched out, teaching himself piano and bass. After years of intense studio and live work, he forged a signature sound that fuses the nostalgic tones of the past with forward-thinking rhythms, creating a captivating electro-organic blend. Based in Charente for the past fifteen years or so, MINIMATIC started out in the 1990s with a wide range of stage-music projects, working notably with Théâtre de la Cité and Compagnie Inouïe. His career took a decisive turn when he moved into institutional sound creation, becoming a key collaborator for the agency Sixième Son in the late 1990s. In that context, he created memorable sonic identities for brands such as Fnac Junior, Etam and Rhône-Poulenc. Under the name Minimatic, he embraced a retro-modern aesthetic in 2003, exploring the intersections of jazz, groove, pop and dance music. His ability to blend traditional and contemporary elements has made him a leading figure on the European vintage, nu-soul and electro-swing scenes. His tracks have been widely released, appearing on more than a hundred international compilations from prestigious labels such as Wagram Music and ChinChin Records. As a composer, MINIMATIC is in high demand from top production-music libraries like Parigo Music and Telemusic, regularly bringing his creativity to television and online projects. His work for picture was particularly celebrated in 2016, when he received a Mark Award in Los Angeles for his album Pigalle Bizarre. MINIMATIC is also very active in the events world, collaborating with luxury brands at major happenings such as the Cannes Film Festival and Milan Fashion Week. As a DJ, he is known for high-energy sets that captivate crowds in iconic clubs across the globe, from Warsaw to Istanbul and from Berlin to Paris. Recognised for his ability to fuse disparate musical genres and create immersive atmospheres, MINIMATIC continues to push the boundaries of contemporary music. His latest album, RIVIERA BIZARRE, perfectly illustrates his love of easy-listening and soul while delving into the darker, more melancholic side of classic pop. His work stands as a living testament to his passion for music and his commitment to artistic innovation.
