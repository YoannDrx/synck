Cédric Hanak, known as Hanak, is a composer and multi-instrumentalist who shapes a true symphony of emotions by fusing synthesizers, analog sound and classical heritage with a distinctly modern approach. After several experiences working in English, he chose to fully embrace the French language and give his folk rock the setting that suits it best. On the album UNE DERNIÈRE FOIS (produced by PARIGO), he co-composes and records as a musician, notably with the track "Fais-moi danser", a chiaroscuro song where words and rhymes are as intoxicating as the melody. With deliberately stripped-back instrumentation, Hanak favors precision over showmanship, allowing each song to etch itself effortlessly into memory. Supported by the sober and fascinating direction of Florian Le Jeune, he reveals himself without filter, exploring the night, its intoxication and its consequences, and asserting an intimate universe where artistic risk becomes the path to finally being fully oneself.
