Blanka is a versatile producer and founding member of the beat-making quartet La Fine Équipe, alongside oOgo, Gib and Chomsky. The first three grew up DJing together in Marseille before moving to Paris, where the group took shape through radio shows such as Fine Cuts on Radio Campus Paris. Deeply rooted in US hip-hop and sample culture, they cite Madlib and J Dilla as key influences. In 2008 they released their debut album La Boulangerie, inviting seven guest beatmakers, and soon after launched their own label Nowadays Records to stay independent. This was followed by Fantastic Planet (2010), La Boulangerie 2 (2011), the EPs Love For Eva (2013) and Gremlins (2014), then La Boulangerie 3 (2014), produced with their live setup and featuring guests such as Superpoze, Everydayz and Fakear ("Cheese Naan"). Supported by media like Radio Nova and Le Mouv' and awarded the Deezer Adami prize and the Inouïs Printemps de Bourges talent springboard, La Fine Équipe went on to tour extensively in France and abroad, before returning with the album 5th Season (2019) and the EP Cycles (2021). Alongside this collective journey, Blanka has been crafting his own solo universe. After Flares, he returned with Birds, an album at the crossroads of lo-fi, instrumental hip-hop and library music, conceived as an ode to nature. In December 2020 he left the city for the countryside in the south of France. On the foundations of an 1840 building, he built his own studio and an apartment designed to host artists seeking peace and quiet while they create. In this unique environment, birdsong became the soundtrack to the seasons and the main inspiration for Birds, imagined as a sonic postcard of life at that moment. While Blanka remains the sole captain of the project, he invites several long-time collaborators (Sara Lugo, Onra…) as well as new musical companions (De Phase, King Krab, Papa Rua…). All tracks were created on site with the same artistic brief: every texture, instrument and guest should serve the central theme, shaping a cohesive, organic and warmly immersive sound world.
