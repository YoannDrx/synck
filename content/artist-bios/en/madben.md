Madben is a French techno DJ and producer from western France. He has released music on labels such as Astropolis Records and Bedrock, crafting a sound that is melodic, rave-infused and firmly aimed at the dancefloor. A true child of techno, he champions an authentic style that stimulates both the mind and the feet. Part of a new generation of producers, he sees it as his mission to honour the pioneers by deconstructing their work. In this, Benjamin Leclercq, aka Madben, is among the finest: inspired by the kings of Detroit, this “prince of machines” handles his gear like an extension of himself, shaping perfectly controlled distortions. Equally at ease in DJ sets and live performances, he has played across Europe (Panorama Bar, Concrete, Rex Club…) and fired up major festivals such as Transmusicales, Piknic Électronik, Panoramas, Marsatac, Scopitone, Nuits Sonores and Offweek.
