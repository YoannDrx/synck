Pierre Millet is a renowned trumpeter and composer and a mainstay of the contemporary music scene, celebrated for the way he fuses jazz with a wide range of styles, from rock to klezmer. Born into a key jazz family in Normandy, he grew up in a rich musical environment shared with his brother, father and great-grandfather – early influences that shaped his distinctive, wide-ranging approach to music. Over the years, Pierre has built up extensive experience on both the French and international scenes, appearing on around thirty albums as leader and composer for projects such as Decor-um, B.L.A.S.T, Renza Bô and Chromatic Museum, as well as a sideman for many other artists. His collaborations span worlds as varied as circus and poetry, underlining his versatility and his ability to transcend stylistic boundaries. His current project, Ana Kap, founded in 2009 with Jean-Michel Trotoux on accordion and Manuel Decocq on violin, perfectly illustrates this spirit. Ana Kap celebrates the playful, popular side of jazz, coloured with Balkan flavours and echoes of guinguette music. Their sound evokes the cinematic worlds of Federico Fellini and Astor Piazzolla, as well as the work of Dave Douglas, a major influence on Pierre.
Ana Kap doesn’t just play music: the trio also embraces a theatrical dimension with their “Trauma Show”, a blend of comedy and music aimed at making their art even more accessible. Directed by Fabrice Bisson, the show weaves together music, songs and short scenes in the style of classic black-and-white films, offering a humorous, deeply human look at friendship and the flashes of life shared between musicians. Alongside Ana Kap, Pierre continues to perform with a wide variety of artists and ensembles, including Palestinian pianist Faraj Suleiman and the groups Surnatural Orchestra and Chromatic Museum. His recent releases with Ana Kap, Topinambour du futur and La gazette de Libor, showcase the breadth of his musical talent and his innovative approach to composition. This remarkable journey makes Pierre Millet a key figure in modern jazz, whose creativity and instrumental mastery continue to enrich the international music scene.
