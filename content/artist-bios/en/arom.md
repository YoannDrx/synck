Straight out of the Lille suburbs, Arom is a true outlier – a clairvoyant cyberpunk who writes as much as he produces. Raised on Midwest US rap, 90s sci-fi movies and video games, the red-haired kid with glasses has built a universe that’s both dark and colorful through numerous collaborations (Madchild, Chino XL, Emsallam, Deadi, La Gale…) and solo projects (John Connor LP, Damien vs Van Helsing EP, 1987 EP) released on the Mutant Ninja label.
Behind the machines, Arom has just as much fun crafting dark, evolving hip-hop beats as he does composing bouncy chiptune or funkwave tracks for renowned production houses such as Parigo, Sonoton, Prodigious, West One… He also contributed to the original soundtrack of Lionel Baier’s film Continental Drift (South) and to the sound design of the video game G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra.
A committed activist, Arom has been taking his mobile studio into social centers for the past six years, running songwriting and recording workshops around rap.
