Jean-Baptiste Hanak is a multifaceted artist who began his career as a visual artist in the mid-1990s before devoting himself entirely to music in 2003. As a member of the duo dDamage with his brother Frédéric, he left a strong mark on the global electronic scene for over fifteen years, becoming a pillar of the French underground. The group released numerous albums on various international labels and played more than 500 shows around the world. Hanak launched his solo career in 2003 with a first album under the alias dDash. Although he officially stepped away from visual arts, he continued to create in private until 2014, when he publicly returned to drawing and painting through a multidisciplinary solo album, Hyperactive Jerk. This project led to an artist residency in Paris, and his work was quickly acknowledged by major figures in the art world. International exhibitions allowed his pieces to enter prestigious private and public collections, including the Musée du Papier in Angoulême, alongside works by Keith Haring. His visual style, dense and saturated, also runs through his music, often an explosive blend of techno-punk and electronic influences. In 2011, dDamage embarked on an Asian tour that started in China and ended in Japan, further cementing their international reputation. Their ability to merge genres attracted a wide audience and helped shape their unique artistic identity. In 2017, JB Hanak began collaborating with feminist filmmaker Olympe de G, marking his entry into film scoring for erotic cinema. The group continued to record and perform until the tragic passing of Frédéric in 2018. After losing his brother and musical partner, Jean-Baptiste carried on innovating as a solo artist. In 2020, he composed the original score for Une Dernière Fois, an adult film directed by Olympe de G, and in 2021 he worked with Mike Patton on the music for a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game. In 2023, his Hexahedre project with Cyril Laurent opened yet another chapter in his exploration of the relationship between music and visual arts, as he continues to push the boundaries of artistic expression.
