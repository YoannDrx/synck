Dorian Chamoin, better known by his stage name Of Ivory & Horn, is a French artist who has crafted a uniquely distinctive musical universe. His alias, drawn from Greek mythology and the gates of dreams, perfectly reflects the ethereal, dreamlike quality of his music which, though rooted in folk, transcends conventions to offer something resolutely modern and innovative. Dorian began his musical journey at the age of five, first studying classical piano, then violin, before turning to guitar and voice. After training in various schools and conservatories, the guitar became his primary instrument, though the piano continues to haunt his artistic expression. The influence of composers such as Arvo Pärt and Debussy is palpable in his work, especially on his debut album, largely made up of pieces originally written for piano and masterfully adapted for guitar. Of Ivory & Horn marks a turning point in his career, signalling a move toward more introspective music and away from the sonic extremes of metal, a genre he once favoured. Acoustic folk and percussive guitar techniques now shape his style, allowing him to create soundscapes that honour silence as much as sound. Behind the name lies a deep concept inspired by Orpheus wandering in the limbo, exploring themes of loss, reflection and personal evolution through music. The project is not merely musical; it is a quest for harmony and melody that invites listeners to lose themselves in a sonic labyrinth, mirroring Orpheus’s search for knowledge and beauty. On stage, Dorian values interaction and risk, favouring raw expression through live vocals and instrumentation rather than relying on samples or backing tracks. His commitment to authenticity is evident in every performance, as he seeks to connect with audiences in a meaningful way. His first music video, created in stop motion, also reflects his dedication to craft, pushing the limits of traditional media to extend and enrich his musical world. Through artistic collaborations in live settings—such as gallery openings where music meets visual art—Dorian continues to explore and merge different forms of expression. Winner of the Zoom 2015 award, he has proven his ability to captivate audiences while learning the demands and challenges of the professional music world. His journey is a testament to his constant evolution as an artist, always ready to push the boundaries of his craft to reach new emotional and aesthetic depths.
