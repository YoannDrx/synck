Aociz is a French DJ and turntablist, founding member of the trio 9 O'Clock alongside DJ Hertz and Mr Viktor. Together, they won the DMC World Team Championship three times (2013, 2014, 2015), establishing themselves as an international reference in turntablism. Building on this technical expertise, Aociz has developed a personal style blending scratch, beat juggling and a sharp sense of production. Within 9 O'Clock, he contributed to the creation of the "Wake Up" EP, the group's first project entirely made of original tracks, moving between bright house and Future Beat electronics. Featured on the Afro Pop and Future Beat compilations released by PARIGO, Aociz continues his journey between spectacular live performances and studio work, helping to put the French scratch scene on the international map.
