Amaury Messelier:
Straight out of the Lille suburbs, Arom is a visionary outlier—a clairvoyant cyberpunk who composes as much as he writes. Raised on Midwest US rap, 90s sci‑fi films and video games, the redheaded, bespectacled artist has built a universe that’s both dark and colorful through numerous collaborations (Madchild, Chino XL, Emsallam, Deadi, La Gale…) and solo projects (LP “John Connor”, EP “Damien vs Van Helsing”, EP “1987”) released on the Mutant Ninja label.
Behind the machines, Arom revels in producing dark, evolving hip-hop beats as much as in crafting bouncy chiptune or funkwave tracks for renowned publishers like Parigo, Sonoton, Prodigious and West One. He also contributed to the soundtrack of Lionel Baier’s film “La dérive des continents (au sud)” and handled sound design for the video game “GI Joe: Wrath Of Cobra”.
A committed activist, Arom has spent the last six years taking his mobile studio into social centers to run rap writing and recording workshops.
