Laurent Dury is a French pianist and composer who began his musical career after classical piano and musicology studies in Montpellier. He later deepened his orchestration skills in England, gaining valuable experience working for various London advertising agencies. This early international background laid the foundations for his eclectic and forward-thinking approach to music. Back in France, Laurent collaborated with influential labels such as Claude Challe, Origins and Buddha Bar. His passion for global sounds led him to explore a wide range of genres, with a particular focus on world-electro fusion. Travels through West Africa, Louisiana, Cuba and Asia broadened his sonic palette and left a deep imprint on his compositions. Over the past decade, Laurent has moved towards more minimalist and orchestral writing, favouring acoustic recordings to capture the true essence of his music. He strongly identifies with the world-electro movement, which aims to weave art into everyday life and make music an essential, omnipresent element. Laurent is also highly regarded for his work in production music and sound design, which he sees not as side activities but as extensions of his artistic vision. His involvement in soundscapes and architectural acoustics has opened new perspectives in the field of sound, placing his work at the crossroads of art and practical function.
His album Minimal Stories Vol. 3, released by PARIGO, encapsulates this artistic approach: a sonic journey that tells a story from beginning to end with a discreet, atmospheric and visual quality. Rooted in floating, contemplative film music, it reflects Laurent’s evolution toward more introspective writing and his search for greater depth of sound. Laurent Dury received the 2019 UNAC Grand Prize for production music, a recognition of his significant contribution to ambient music and sound design. His career testifies to his ability to fuse diverse influences into works that transcend traditional musical boundaries, making him a key figure in the contemporary world of professional music.
