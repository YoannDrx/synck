Yann Jankielewicz immersed himself in the world of music from a very young age. At just seven, he hosted his first radio show, Malabar Super 9, on Radio 9, and by ten he was working as a record runner at Radio Méduse. His childhood was steeped in a wide range of styles – from French chanson to soul, funk and American folk. His musical path truly began in Lunel, where he first played bugle in a banda before discovering the alto saxophone as a teenager, an instrument his mother spontaneously bought for him. This choice marked the start of intensive studies that took him from the Templeuve concert band to Paris conservatoires, where he specialised in jazz and classical composition. In 1998, Yann travelled to Havana to refine his saxophone and percussion skills. His career took on an international dimension when he attended the Siena International Jazz Seminar, where he was awarded a scholarship. Over the years, he has multiplied prestigious collaborations, both on stage and in the studio, working with artists such as Mano Solo, Sébastien Tellier, Alpha Blondy, Michel Petrucciani, Mathieu Chedid, Youssou Ndour and many others. He has also been a member of ensembles including Surnatural Orchestra, the big band NivuNiconnu and Daniel Mizrahi’s sextet.
In 2008, he founded the tentet Vaporetto, blending jazz, improvised music and film score aesthetics. This period also marked the beginning of his work as a composer and producer for audiovisual projects, including music for television and film, and theme tunes for programmes such as Thalassa. In 2016, Yann decided to deepen his expertise in sound engineering by studying at Abbey Road Institute France. He then worked as a sound engineer and producer on various projects, further strengthening his reputation in the field. His encounter with Tony Allen in 2008 proved decisive: Yann became a permanent member of the drummer’s band until Allen’s passing in 2020, collaborating closely on major projects. More recently, in 2021, he co-launched the album Quirky Jazz Parade, released and produced by PARIGO, and continued to explore new musical horizons with his first album recorded in New York in 2022, alongside renowned musicians such as Josh Dion and Jason Lindner. Yann Jankielewicz continues to leave an indelible mark on the international music scene, recognised for his eclecticism and multifaceted talent.
