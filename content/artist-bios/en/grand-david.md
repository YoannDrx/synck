David Rieu, better known by his stage name Grand David, is a versatile French artist and accomplished composer active since 2001. Born in Montpellier, he now divides his time between Paris and Berlin, where he pursues his passion for music across a wide spectrum of genres. Grand David has set himself apart with a unique style that cleverly blends vintage and modern elements, reflected both in his choice of instruments and in his compositions. Working from a studio filled with synthesizers, guitars and vocoders, Grand David channels the sound of past decades while injecting a contemporary freshness into his work. His albums Disco World and Sci-Fi Era, released by Cezame, showcase his ability to create a variety of moods, from dancefloor-ready disco-era tracks to futuristic, cosmic themes. Alongside his solo projects, he has collaborated with a range of artists, including Emma Lamadji, with whom he explored a fusion of soul and instrumental music on the track “Middle of the Night” from the album Lady & Soul. These collaborations broaden his repertoire and highlight his capacity to transcend musical genres. Grand David draws inspiration from iconic figures in music and sound illustration such as François de Roubaix, Roger Roger and Raymond Scott. Their influence can be heard in his way of composing pieces that are both kitsch and sophisticated, where humour and finesse intertwine. His work spans a wide range of production music created for libraries such as Zomba Music, Koka Media/BMG Publishing, Telemusic, Encore Merci, Parigo and Cezame Music.
His style—at once clean and dripping, classy and unbuttoned, vintage and modern—makes Grand David a distinctive presence on the contemporary music scene, able to reach a wide audience with his diverse and captivating compositions.
