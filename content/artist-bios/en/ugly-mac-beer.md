Ugly Mac Beer began his career in the late 1990s as the DJ for the group La Formule, alongside Wax Tailor. In the 2000s, eager to develop his own projects, he launched a solo career. He quickly became a key figure on the French turntablism / scratch scene, both as an artist and as a prolific independent producer with his label Beatsqueeze Records. In the mid-2000s he started collaborating with fellow digger/beatmaker Mister Modo. Their chemistry led to a series of projects featuring numerous international guests and major names from the culture, including MF Grimm, Kool Keith, Psycho Les (Beatnuts), Guilty Simpson, Mike Ladd, El Da Sensei, DJ D-Styles and more. In 2009, the release of the album Modonut received strong media exposure and found real success with a wider audience. The 70s-soul-tinged track “Not Afraid” (ft. Jessica Fitoussi) was heavily played on radio and brought the duo international airplay. The second album from the pair, simply titled Modonut 2 and released in 2012, produced another hip-hop banger, “Diggin in the Crates” (ft. F. Stokes), widely supported by DJs across Europe and North America. Increasingly in demand for sync work in advertising and film, Ugly Mac Beer discovered a passion for the audiovisual world. Long inspired by television, pop culture, cinema and music in the broadest sense, he has now found his place as a full-time composer for music to picture.
