Cally Reed is a rapper from Tacoma, Washington, first known as a member of the group Second Family before stepping into the spotlight as a solo artist. A respected figure on the local hip-hop scene, he has built a reputation as a hard worker, delivering music that stands up to industry standards in a city that's often underestimated. With his solo project "Call Me Cally", he delivers a true artistic statement: a way to embrace a new name, a new identity, while carrying the legacy of Second Family and its fanbase. On this record, Cally Reed blends clear West Coast influences with production and concepts that feel fully in tune with the present. Tracks like "S.D.S. (Super Dupa Supreme)" and "Liquor and Dope" radiate summer energy, while "Off That" and "Livin Homie" move between tense celebration and introspection, where he talks about his own life, that of his people, and what he sees around him. With "Call Me Cally", he positions himself as a potential voice for Tacoma: an artist who questions his place, claims his journey, and refuses to let anyone downplay his work. Through personal writing and a strong sense of crowd-pleasing tracks, Cally Reed seems more ready than ever to move beyond the simple label of "local" and put his city on the wider map of American rap.
