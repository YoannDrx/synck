Forever Pavot is the project of French multi-instrumentalist Émile Sornin, sitting somewhere between psychedelic pop, progressive rock and imaginary film scores. Signed to Born Bad Records, the band stands out for its baroque orchestrations and strong 60s–70s influences. Sornin, a former film student, classy tinkerer and multi-instrumentalist, loves telling stories – these days with a new partner: a vocoder-voiced robot that almost does everything in his place. After several albums, videos, short films and 60s–70s-inspired soundtracks, he created the progressive pop-rock band Forever Pavot in 2012.On L’Idiophone, Forever Pavot’s latest album released in March 2023, Émile crafts dreamlike songs conceived as short film scenes, where the influence of 60s–70s soundtracks and his work for the screen is fully felt. That same year, he composed the original score for La Morsure, directed by Romain de Saint-Blanquat, and for Monia Chokri’s feature film Simple comme Sylvain, selected at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section. He has just completed the score for L’Engloutie by Louise Hémon, selected for the Directors’ Fortnight at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.
