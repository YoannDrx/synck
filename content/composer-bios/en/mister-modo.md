Mister Modo:
A die-hard crate digger, beatmaker and seasoned record dealer, Mister Modo has been a fixture in Paris’ top shops since the late 90s. He has released numerous projects, including the celebrated Modonut series with his partner Ugly Mac Beer.
His endless curiosity, creativity and ever-growing musical knowledge make him a sharp “samples & beats” specialist, and a collector of rare, essential records. His next album, “Music for Bugs”, is on the way.
