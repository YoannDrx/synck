Sébastien Blanchon:
Sébastien Blanchon, better known as N’zeng, is a French trumpeter, composer and DJ born October 28, 1974 near Saint-Étienne. Trained at the Massenet Conservatory in Saint-Étienne and the Lyon Regional Conservatory, he earned a first prize in cornet, launching his rich career.
N’zeng has explored many genres, from jazz-funk with Mo’Jazz Beat to contemporary urban and electronic influences. His pivotal encounter with Le Peuple de l’Herbe led him to join the group from 1999 to 2013. He contributed to six studio albums—including “Triple Zéro” and “Cube”—and two live albums, totaling 700+ international shows. The band won a Victoire de la Musique in 2002 (“Découverte Scène”).
Beyond Le Peuple de l’Herbe, N’zeng has collaborated with renowned artists such as Beth Gibbons (Portishead) and groups like Asian Dub Foundation and Mes Teï Sho. In 2005 he co-wrote “Les Beaux Jours” with Agoria, renewing the partnership in 2011 with “Under the River” and again in 2016 for Jan Kounen’s documentaries.
In 2014 he joined beatmaker collective L’Entourloop, contributing to the album “Chicken in Your Town” and touring with them. He produced tracks for Stupeflip’s DJ Docteur Vince and worked on diverse projects including contemporary dance scores and film music.
His composition skills have been tapped for film, including recording a rewritten orchestral score for excerpts of Ridley Scott’s “Alien”. In 2017 he collaborated with Rone on “Switches” for the album “Mirapolis”.
In 2019 his album “HOLLYWOOD HUSTLERS” came out on Parigo Music to critical praise, including from Télérama. Sébastien Blanchon continues to impact the scene with compositions like those for Arcosm’s “Hôtel Bellevue”.
His latest project “The Trip” marks a new step, exploring trip-hop with Charlotte Savary’s voice (Wax Tailor). It perfectly balances rich acoustic instrumentation and innovative beatmaking, with N’zeng’s trumpet gracefully guiding listeners through the journey.
