Pierre Millet:
Trumpeter and composer Pierre Millet is a pillar of the contemporary scene, renowned for fusing jazz with a wide range of genres from rock to klezmer. Raised in a jazz-loving Norman family, he grew up surrounded by music alongside his brother, father and great-grandfather. Those early influences forged his unique, diverse approach.
Over the years Pierre has built substantial experience on French and international stages, appearing on around thirty albums as leader and composer for projects like Decor-um, B.L.A.S.T, Renza Bô and Chromatic Museum, as well as sideman for many others. His collaborations span circus to poetry, underscoring his versatility and ability to transcend genres.
His current project, Ana Kap (created in 2009), perfectly illustrates that range. With Jean-Michel Trotoux on accordion and Manuel Decocq on violin, Ana Kap celebrates the playful, popular spirit of jazz with Balkan colors and hints of guinguette. Their music evokes film scores by Federico Fellini and Astor Piazzolla, and the work of Dave Douglas—a key influence for Pierre.
Ana Kap goes beyond music: the trio also crafts theatrical experiences like their “Trauma show”, mixing comedy and music to make their art more accessible. Directed by Fabrice Bisson, it blends music, songs and skits reminiscent of classic black-and-white films, offering a humorous, human glimpse into friendship dynamics and life’s sparks.
Outside Ana Kap, Pierre performs with artists and ensembles such as Palestinian pianist Faraj Suleiman, Surnatural Orchestra and Chromatic Museum. Two recent Ana Kap albums—“Topinambour du futur” and “La gazette de Libor”—showcase his musical breadth and innovative approach to writing.
This exceptional journey makes Pierre Millet a key figure in modern jazz, whose creativity and mastery continue to enrich the international stage.
