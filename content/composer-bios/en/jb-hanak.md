JB Hanak:
Jean-Baptiste Hanak is a multidisciplinary artist who began as a visual artist in the mid-90s before dedicating himself fully to music in 2003. As half of the duo dDamage with his brother Frédéric, they became pillars of the French underground electronic scene for over fifteen years, releasing numerous albums on international labels and playing 500+ shows worldwide.
Going solo, Jean-Baptiste released his first album as dDash in 2003, launching a prolific solo track. Though he officially stepped back from visual arts, he continued quietly until 2014, when he returned to drawing and painting via the multidisciplinary solo album “Hyperactive Jerk”. It led to an artist residency in Paris and rapid recognition from major art figures.
International exhibitions brought his work into private and public collections, including the Musée du Papier in Angoulême alongside pieces by Keith Haring. His saturated, rich visual style also permeates his music, often an explosive mix of techno-punk and electronic influences.
In 2011 dDamage’s Asia tour started in China and wrapped in Japan, cementing their global reputation. Their genre-blending attracted a wide audience and reinforced their unique artistic identity.
In 2017 JB Hanak began collaborating with feminist filmmaker Olympe de G, entering the realm of music for erotic cinema. The band continued until Frédéric’s tragic passing in 2018; Jean-Baptiste then pushed forward as a solo innovator.
In 2020 he scored “Une Dernière fois”, an adult film by Olympe de G, and in 2021 he worked with Mike Patton on the soundtrack for a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game. In 2023 his Hexahedre project with Cyril Laurent marked fresh exploration at the crossroads of music and visual art, continuing to push the boundaries of expression.
