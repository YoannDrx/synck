Aïwa:
Formed in 1998 by brothers Wamid and Naufalle Al Wahab, originally from Iraq and raised in France, Aïwa is a collective that brilliantly fuses classical Arabic sounds with modern Western electronic rhythms. The name means “yes” in Arabic, reflecting their positive, assertive approach to building bridges between musical cultures.
From childhood, the Al Wahab brothers were immersed in icons like Oum Kalthoum and Abdel Halim Hafez, influences that run deep in their sound. Wamid plays bass, Naufalle is a darbuka player and Arabic rapper; together they added electronic touches to craft a unique blend of electronica and traditional Arabic elements.
The group expanded with Rennes-based talents: Séverine (vocals/composition), Gaël (sax/flute), DJ Sambal (turntables), Damien (guitar) and Matt (drums). This collaboration broadened their palette and welcomed diverse influences into their music.
Their first major break came in 2002 with a signing to Canadian label Wikkid Records, leading to the release of their debut album in May 2003. It gained international distribution, reaching audiences across Europe and the Middle East.
Their second album, “Elnar” (“the fire” in Arabic), showed growing maturity and confirmed their knack for innovation. It deftly blends hip-hop, Arabic music and global influences, with standout tracks such as “Elnar”, “Dioud” and “Ibn Sina”. Guest vocals like Anissa Derkaoui’s add another dimension to their already rich sound.
Aïwa also made waves live, particularly with a memorable performance at Transmusicales de Rennes in 2000. Their shows often feature live video, adding a visual layer to their bold, experimental music.
Crossing and redefining genres, Aïwa keep fascinating and innovating—honoring their cultural roots while fearlessly exploring new musical territories. Their music is more than a fusion of sounds; it’s a genuine dialogue between cultures, cementing Aïwa as an essential voice in today’s musical landscape.
