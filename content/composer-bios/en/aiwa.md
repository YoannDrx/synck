Formed in 1998 by brothers Wamid and Naufalle Al Wahab, of Iraqi origin and raised in France, Aïwa is a musical collective that brilliantly fuses the sounds of classical Arabic music with the rhythms of modern Western electronic music. The group’s name, meaning “yes” in Arabic, reflects their positive, assertive approach, seeking to build bridges between different musical cultures.
From an early age, the Al Wahab brothers were immersed in the melodies of icons such as Oum Kalthoum and Abdel Halim Hafez, influences that run deep through their music. Wamid, a bassist, and Naufalle, a specialist in derbouka and Arabic rap, expanded their sound with electronic textures, creating a unique style that blends electronica with traditional Arabic elements.
The group grew to include several musicians from Rennes: Séverine on vocals and composition, Gaël on saxophone and flute, DJ Sambal on turntables, Damien on guitar, and Matt on drums. This collaboration broadened their sonic palette and allowed them to integrate a wide range of influences into their music.
Their first major breakthrough came in 2002 when they signed with Canadian label Wikkid Records, which released their debut album in May 2003. The record enjoyed international distribution, reaching audiences across many countries, from Europe to the Middle East.
Their second album, Elnar (meaning “the fire” in Arabic), showcased a growing maturity and confirmed their ability to innovate. The album skillfully combines hip-hop, Arabic music and global influences, with standout tracks such as “Elnar”, “Dioud”, and “Ibn Sina”. Guest vocals, including that of Anissa Derkaoui, enriched the project and added another dimension to their already dense sound.
Aïwa also made a strong impression on stage, notably with memorable performances at the Transmusicales de Rennes in 2000. Their live shows are enhanced by video performances, adding a visual layer to their bold, experimental music.
With a style that crosses and redefines genres, Aïwa continues to captivate and innovate, offering a musical experience that is both a tribute to their cultural roots and a daring exploration of new musical territories. Their music is not just a fusion of sounds, but a true dialogue between cultures, making Aïwa a key group on the contemporary music scene.
