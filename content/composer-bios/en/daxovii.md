Daxovii is a Beninese DJ and composer based in France, a devoted "discjoker" driven by a deep passion for music. Drawing from afro-pop, coupé-décalé and contemporary urban sounds, he crafts an energetic style built on dance-oriented grooves and uplifting melodies. As a solo artist, he can be heard on tracks such as Côd'ivoir Pissanci, and as a guest on standout cuts like DJ Hertz's Louis Vie, as well as the compilation Afro Pop (Parigo No.36). Both behind the decks and in the studio, Daxovii shapes a warm, festive sound made for the dancefloor as much as for playlists, steadily establishing himself as one of the rising voices of the new Afro scene in France.
