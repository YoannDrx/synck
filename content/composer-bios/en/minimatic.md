Minimatic:
Pascal Houpert, professionally known as MINIMATIC, is a French artist famed for his retro-modern musical approach. He started at 14 as a rock drummer, quickly diversifying to self-taught piano and bass. After years of intense studio and stage work, he forged a signature that fuses nostalgic tones with forward-looking rhythms—a captivating electro-organic blend.
Based in Charente for about fifteen years, MINIMATIC began in the 90s with varied stage music experiences, notably with Théâtre de la Cité and Compagnie Inouïe. His career pivoted when he moved into institutional sound design, becoming a lead collaborator for agency Sixième Son by the late 90s and crafting memorable sonic identities for brands like Fnac Junior, Etam and RhônePoulenc.
Under the Minimatic moniker he embraced retro-modern aesthetics in 2003, exploring the intersections of jazz, groove, pop and dance. His ability to mix traditional and modern elements made him a leading voice on Europe’s vintage, nu-soul and electro-swing scenes. His tracks have appeared on 100+ international compilations from labels such as Wagram Music and ChinChin Records.
As a composer, MINIMATIC is highly sought after by renowned libraries like Parigo Music and Telemusic, regularly bringing his creativity to TV and online projects. His work for picture was celebrated in 2016 with a Mark Award in Los Angeles for the album “Pigalle Bizarre”.
MINIMATIC is also active in events, collaborating with luxury brands at major gatherings like the Cannes Film Festival and Milan Fashion Week. As a DJ he’s known for energetic sets that light up clubs worldwide, from Warsaw and Istanbul to Berlin and Paris.
Acclaimed for fusing disparate genres and building immersive atmospheres, MINIMATIC keeps pushing contemporary music forward. His latest album “RIVIERA BIZARRE” embodies his love of easy-listening and soul while exploring darker, melancholic shades of classic pop. His body of work is living proof of his passion and commitment to artistic innovation.
