Cyril Laurent is a leading artist from the south of France, best known for his solo project LAMBWOOL, an ambient and atmospheric musical journey launched in 2000. Influenced by icons such as Dead Can Dance, Tangerine Dream, Labradford and Brian Eno, Laurent has crafted a distinctive sound that runs through his many releases.
From the outset, Cyril Laurent attracted attention on the music scene. Winner of the D-Side Magazine talent contest in 2001, he quickly made his mark, with his albums regularly praised by the specialist press. His ability to build meaningful collaborations with renowned French and international artists such as Nicolas Dick (Kill the Thrill), Cruise CTRL and LAAG testifies to both his influence and the respect he commands in the industry.
A highlight of his career came with his participation in the 2009 project Electronic Manifesto, a tribute to Mute Records, where his cover of a Depeche Mode track was singled out and acknowledged by the band themselves, confirming his talent for honouring and transforming other artists’ work with integrity and imagination.
Alongside LAMBWOOL, Laurent has distinguished himself as a composer for film and television, writing scores for major broadcasters such as Canal+, France 5 and France 3. His music is currently distributed by prestigious companies including Bucks Music Group in the UK, and 5Alarm Music and Spirit Production Music in the United States.
Beyond his solo work, Cyril embarked on a notable collaboration with JB Hanak for the project Hexahedre. Together, they created an album conceived as a true artistic exploration, an immersion in the sacred and the astral. The project combines Hanak’s e-bow guitar lines and noisy analogue keyboards with Laurent’s ambient, rhythmic and production work.
Hexahedre represents a special facet of his career, showcasing his ability to fuse sound and visual arts in a deeply experimental and spiritual approach. The album, the result of several years of musical exchanges, was mixed by Laurent, while Hanak handled the visual dimension, both aiming to capture a chamanic, hypnotic musical atmosphere.
With more than two decades of activity and a lasting impact on the ambient and electronic scenes, Cyril Laurent continues to reinvent himself and push boundaries. His commitment to audiovisual art and music makes his work not only relevant, but essential listening for music lovers around the world.
