Cyril Laurent:
Cyril Laurent is a leading artist from southern France, best known for his solo project LAMBWOOL—an ambient, atmospheric journey begun in 2000. Influenced by Dead Can Dance, Tangerine Dream, Labradford and Brian Eno, Laurent has sculpted a distinct sound across many releases.
From the start, he drew attention: winner of D-Side Magazine’s Tremplin in 2001, consistently praised by the music press, and a trusted collaborator with acclaimed French and international artists such as Nicolas Dick (Kill the Thrill), Cruise CTRL and LAAG. A highlight came with “Electronic Manifesto”, a 2009 tribute to Mute Records, where his Depeche Mode cover was personally acknowledged by the band—proof of his ability to honor and transform others’ work with integrity and innovation.
Alongside LAMBWOOL, Laurent scores for television, contributing to Canal+, France 5 and France 3. His work is now distributed by Bucks Music Group (UK) and 5Alarm Music and Spirit Production Music (US).
He also teamed up with JB Hanak on the project Hexahedre. Together they created an album conceived as an immersion into sacred and astral realms—Hanak on guitar ebow and analog noise synths, Laurent on ambient textures, rhythms and production. Hexahedre’s concept-driven music blends sound and visuals, the result of years of musical exchange, finalized by Laurent’s mixing and Hanak’s visuals to capture a chamanic, hypnotic atmosphere.
With over two decades in ambient and electronic scenes, Cyril Laurent keeps reinventing himself and pushing boundaries. His dedication to audiovisual work and music makes his output both relevant and essential to listeners worldwide.
