Jacques Sahloul, better known under his stage name Liqid, is a French-Syrian hip-hop artist who blends wild humour, geek culture and razor-sharp punchlines. Born in Vaulx-en-Velin, where he first nurtured his love of rap, Tarafa – as he prefers to be called – grew from a neighbourhood freestyler into a recognised figure of the French hip-hop scene. Co-founder of the Mutant Ninja label and long-time artistic director at the distributor Idol, Liqid has contributed to many influential projects. His musical path includes standout collaborations and albums that have reached a wide audience, such as Trop jeune pour mûrir with Les Gourmets, his solo record Liqid contre le reste du monde, and Imbéciles heureux with Tcheep. His work is driven by an infectious energy and a style that ranges from lo-fi boom bap to futuristic trap rhythms. Beyond his musical career, Liqid is distinguished by his humanist commitment, notably through the Wameed project, which offers rap and video workshops to refugee children in Amman, Jordan — an initiative that also led to a documentary, highlighting its deep impact. He has also put his talent at the service of social causes, as illustrated by the compilation Amal, created to support the Syrian population. This wordless album was a way for him to reconnect with his Arab roots and to take part in concrete acts of solidarity. Despite his success, Liqid remains humble and insists that his artistic work is driven by a spirit of freedom and a desire to give meaning to what he creates. An artist of both heart and conviction, he continues to push the boundaries of French rap while staying firmly grounded in his values and origins.
