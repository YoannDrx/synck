Liqid:
Jacques Sahloul, known as Liqid, is a French-Syrian hip-hop artist who blends irreverent humor, geek culture and razor-sharp punchlines. Born in Vaulx-en-Velin, where he nurtured his love of rap, Tarafa—as he prefers to be called—evolved from neighborhood freestyler into a recognized figure on the hip-hop scene.
Co-founder of the Mutant Ninja label and long-time artistic director at distributor Idol, Liqid has driven many influential projects. His catalogue includes standout collaborations and albums that reached broad audiences, such as “Trop jeune pour mûrir” with Les Gourmets, solo record “Liqid contre le reste du monde”, and “Imbéciles heureux” with Tcheep. His work brims with an infectious energy and slides from lo-fi boom bap to futuristic trap.
Beyond music, Liqid is defined by his humanist commitment, notably through Wameed, a project offering rap and video workshops to refugee children in Amman, Jordan—a journey captured in a documentary. He also lent his talent to social causes, like the “Amal” compilation supporting the Syrian population, a wordless album that let him reconnect with his Arab roots while driving a concrete act of solidarity.
Despite success, Liqid stays modest, guided by freedom and meaning in his art. An artist of heart and conviction, he keeps pushing the boundaries of French rap while staying grounded in his values and origins.
