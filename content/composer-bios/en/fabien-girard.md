Fabien Girard is an accomplished artist in the music world, working as a composer and sound designer since 2005. His career began in childhood, when he discovered classical guitar at the age of nine. This early passion for music evolved into more eclectic tastes during his teenage years, as he explored rock, grunge and folk, before blossoming into jazz, funk and groove. His boundless curiosity led him to embrace a wide range of influences from the musical cultures of North India, Ethiopia, West Africa and Brazil, before diving into electronic music and synthesizer programming.By the age of 18, Fabien was already recording his own compositions. His first professional commission came in 2005 from Galeries Lafayette, marking the start of his career in composing for advertising, fashion and documentaries. He also co-founded the bands Arat Kilo in 2008 and Balaphonics in 2012, with whom he recorded several albums and toured internationally.
Fabien stands out for his refusal to confine himself to any single genre. Entirely self-taught, he has developed a unique approach to composition, focused more on sound than on traditional melody. His working method is to think about melody and timbre at the same time, considering the sonic space and the intention behind each note. While his live performances often highlight groove, jazz and world music, his screen work leans towards electronic music, sound design and pop. He excels at weaving together diverse influences while adding his own signature, moving effortlessly from minimalist electro beats to symphonic orchestral writing.Before devoting himself fully to music, Fabien earned a solid academic background in economics and management from the Sorbonne and gained significant experience in the music business, working at a record label as well as in management and booking. His love for music ultimately won out, leading him to embrace his vocation as a full-time professional musician. His journey reflects not only his talent and versatility, but also his deep commitment to his art.
