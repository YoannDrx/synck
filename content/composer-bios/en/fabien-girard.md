Fabien Girard:
Fabien Girard is an accomplished composer and sound designer since 2005. His journey began at age nine with classical guitar, then broadened in his teens through rock, grunge and folk, before blossoming into jazz, funk and groove. An insatiable curiosity led him to absorb influences from North India, Ethiopia, West Africa and Brazil, and eventually dive into electronic music and synth programming.
By 18 he was recording his own works. His first professional commission came in 2005 from Galeries Lafayette, launching a career across ads, fashion and documentaries. He co-founded Arat Kilo in 2008 and Balaphonics in 2012, recording multiple albums and touring internationally.
Fabien refuses to be boxed into a single genre. Entirely self-taught, he centers his writing on sound as much as melody—thinking about tone, space and intent all at once. While his live shows often spotlight groove, jazz and world music, his screen compositions lean toward electronic music, sound design and pop. He seamlessly jumps from minimalist electro beats to symphonic work, always imprinting his own signature.
Before dedicating himself fully to music, Fabien earned a strong economics/management background at the Sorbonne and worked in a record label, artist management and booking. Ultimately his love for music prevailed, leading him to embrace life as a professional musician. His path showcases his talent, versatility and deep commitment to his craft.
