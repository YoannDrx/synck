Aeon Seven:
Before tearing up the road with his electro project Christine, Aeon Seven was one of the first turntablists in his region—a walking encyclopedia of hip-hop, funk and obscure samples.
Music and skateboarding defined his teens with Jason Lee, Matt Hensley, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Sonic Youth as the backdrop. A guitarist in a short-lived punk-rock band and an early digger, he built his taste by collecting second-hand vinyl. The switch flipped in 1995 when he discovered DJ Shadow and DJ Qbert. He dove deeper into hip-hop, bought a second turntable and a mixer, mined all his records and became a DJ. As resident of the mythic Café Curieux, he started producing in 2000 and released his first vinyl “Beyond The Time Barrier”, a set of hip-hop instrumentals and sound beds aimed at turntablists. He was booked in 2003 at Rock Dans Tous Ses Etats and shared the stage in 2004 with Hexstatic and Modeselektor at Nördik Impakt #6. In 2005 he dropped the EP “Funky Furious”, revealing his love for deep-funk and the drum breaks that underpin hip-hop production.
In late 2007 Aeon Seven met Kunst Throw, a young DJ with similar tastes. Their explosive shows blended hip-hop/funk/rock influences with the buzzing new electro scene. In 2010 they founded Christine. The duo first stood out for their live sets, won the Booster contest (sponsored by FAIR) in 2011 and were selected the same year for “Découvertes du Printemps de Bourges” and Transmusicales de Rennes. In 2012 they landed the “78 tours” and Les Détours d’Adami tours, playing major francophone festivals (Francofolies, Vieilles Charrues, Solidays, MEG in Montréal, Sakifo on Réunion, Eurockéennes, Montreux, Paléo…). Two EPs—“Catharsis” and “Death On Wheels”—dropped that year, followed by two self-produced EPs (“Ecstatic Sole”, “Brand New Furies”) and the full score for the genre film “Sam Was Here” by Christophe Deroo.
A DJ and producer active for 20+ years, this vinyl die-hard left Christine in late 2015 to return solo to his first loves. After producing since 2000, AEON SEVEN’s debut album “Hand Funktion” is finally here. This French maestro has been a creative force across production, DJing, graphic design and animation. First noticed by the global funk/breaks community with the “Funky Furious EP” (2005), he kept putting out killer mixtapes that showcase his dexterity on decks and in the studio. He released singles on 45 Live Records and clever DJ “tool” records via the ‘Thundercuts’ 7″ and 12″ series.
All along, Aeon Seven honed both his musical and visual craft. His love of instrumentals and of film scores, psych, jazz and funk shines through everything he does. From the cosmic harp-led opener “Outer Space Illusion”, the eerie atmospheres of “The Hidden Hand” to the uptempo blaxploitation funk of “Mankind Hunt”, Aeon Seven’s command of composition is mature and sharply executed.
