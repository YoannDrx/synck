Before going full throttle with his electro project Christine, Aeon Seven was one of the first turntablists in his region, endlessly knowledgeable about hip-hop, funk and all kinds of obscure samples. Music and skateboarding set the pace of his teenage years, with Jason Lee, Matt Hensley, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Sonic Youth in the background. A guitarist in a short-lived punk-rock band and a “digger” before the term became widespread, he built his musical culture by collecting second-hand vinyl records. The turning point came in 1995 when he discovered DJ Shadow and DJ Qbert. From then on, he immersed himself in hip-hop culture, bought a second turntable and a mixer, dug into all the records he had accumulated and became a DJ. Resident at the legendary Café Curieux, he turned to music production in 2000 and released his first vinyl, Beyond The Time Barrier — a record made up of hip-hop instrumentals and sound tools designed for turntablists. He was later booked at the Rock Dans Tous Ses États festival in 2003, and in 2004 shared the stage with Hexstatic and Modeselektor at Nördik Impakt #6. In 2005, he released the Funky Furious EP, revealing his passion for deep funk and drum breaks, the very foundations of hip-hop production.
At the end of 2007, Aeon Seven met Kunst Throw, a young DJ who shared the same musical influences. They started playing wild shows together, blending their hip-hop/funk/rock background with the then-booming new electro scene. In 2010, they founded the project Christine. The duo first made a name for itself on stage, winning the Booster competition sponsored by the FAIR in 2011, and being selected the same year for the “Discoveries” program at Le Printemps de Bourges and for the Transmusicales de Rennes. In 2012, they landed the “78 Tours” and “Les Détours d’Adami” tours, which took them to some of the biggest French-speaking festivals (Francofolies, Vieilles Charrues, Solidays, MEG in Montreal, Sakifo in La Réunion, Eurockéennes, Montreux and Paléo in Switzerland, etc.). The group released two EPs, Catharsis and Death On Wheels, that same year, followed by two self-produced EPs, Ecstatic Sole and Brand New Furies, and then the full score for Christophe Deroo’s genre film Sam Was Here.
An active DJ and producer for over 20 years and an unconditional vinyl enthusiast, he left Christine at the end of 2015 to return to his first loves as a solo artist. After a producer career that began in 2000, Aeon Seven’s first full-length album, Hand Funktion, is finally here. This French maestro has been a creative force in every field he touches: production, DJing, graphic design and animation. First noticed by the global funk/breaks community with his outstanding Funky Furious EP (2005), he went on to release a series of stunning mixtapes that showcase his dexterity both on the decks and in the studio. He has put out several singles on 45 Live Records, as well as clever DJ tool records with the Thundercuts series on 7″ and 12″.
All the while, Aeon Seven has honed his craft both musically and visually. His love of instrumentals and his clear affection for film scores, psychedelia, jazz and funk shines through in all his productions. From the harp-driven cosmic soundscape of the opening track “Outer Space Illusion” and the strange, atmospheric themes of “The Hidden Hand” to the uptempo blaxploitation-style funk of “Mankind Hunt”, Aeon Seven’s command of musical composition is fully mature and masterfully executed.
