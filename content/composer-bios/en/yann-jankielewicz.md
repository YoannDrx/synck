Yann Jankielewicz:
Yann Jankielewicz dove into music early. At seven he hosted his first radio show, “Malabar super 9”, on Radio 9, and by ten he was a record-flipper at Radio Méduse. His childhood was steeped in French chanson, soul, funk and American folk.
His musical journey took off in Lunel, where he played bugle in a banda before discovering alto sax in his teens—an instrument his mother spontaneously bought him. That choice sparked intense study, from the Templeuve harmony orchestra to Paris conservatories, specializing in jazz and classical writing.
In 1998 Yann traveled to Havana to refine sax and percussion, then gained international footing at Siena’s jazz seminar, earning a scholarship.
Over the years he has stacked prestigious collaborations, on stage and in studio, with Mano Solo, Sébastien Tellier, Alpha Blondy, Michel Petrucciani, Mathieu Chedid, Youssou Ndour and many more. He has also been part of ensembles like Surnatural Orchestra, big band NivuNiconnu and Daniel Mizrahi’s sextet.
In 2008 he founded the tentet “Vaporetto”, mixing jazz, free improvisation and film music. This period also marked his entry into composition and production for picture, including television and film scores and TV theme songs such as Thalassa.
In 2016 Yann expanded his audio skills at Abbey Road Institute France. He then worked as a recording and mix engineer on various projects, solidifying his reputation.
Meeting Tony Allen in 2008 was pivotal: Yann became a permanent member of Allen’s band until the drummer’s passing in 2020, collaborating closely on major projects.
Recently, in 2021, Yann co-released “Quirky Jazz Parade” (PARIGO) and continues exploring new horizons with his first album tracked in New York in 2022 alongside musicians like Josh Dion and Jason Lindner.
Yann Jankielewicz keeps leaving an indelible mark on the international scene, celebrated for his eclecticism and multidimensional talent.
