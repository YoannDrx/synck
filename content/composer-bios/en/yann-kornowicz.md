Yann Kornowicz:
The son of violinists, Yann grew up on classical music and spent five years at the conservatory studying violin. Two composer uncles fed him John Adams, Steve Reich, Lutosławski, Philip Glass and the late-20th-century contemporary scene.
As a teenager he discovered that music for picture draws on all these influences at once, and he fell in love with that playground. Self-taught, he primarily writes genre music that nods to specific eras. It’s never pastiche: the artistic goal is to twist those time-worn influences into a musical uchronia on the edge of hauntology, with a taste for darker moods.
Over the years he turned professional. Alongside his albums, he writes for documentaries, ads, exhibitions and production music, while serving as music director on many film sets.
He now runs his production and recording studio near Paris Saint-Lazare: Silvercut Studio.
