Laurent Dury:
French pianist and composer Laurent Dury began his career after classical piano and musicology studies in Montpellier, then honed orchestration in England, gaining valuable experience with London ad agencies. That early international exposure shaped his eclectic, forward-looking approach.
Back in France he collaborated with influential labels like Claude Challe, Origins and Buddha Bar. His taste for global sounds pushed him to explore genres and focus on world‑electro fusions. Travels through Sub-Saharan Africa, Louisiana, Cuba and Asia deepened his palette and left a mark on his writing.
In the last decade he has turned toward minimalist and orchestral music, favoring acoustic recordings to capture the essence of his compositions. He strongly identifies with world‑electro’s goal of weaving art into daily life, making music a constant, essential presence.
Laurent is also recognized for library music and sound design, viewing these not as side gigs but as extensions of his artistic vision. His work on soundscapes and architectural acoustics opens new perspectives at the crossroads of art and practical function.
His album “Minimal Stories 3”, released by PARIGO, distills his artistic approach—telling a story from start to finish with atmospheric, visual, understated quality. It sits firmly in the realm of airy, contemplative, cinematic writing, showing his progression toward deeper, more immersive sound.
Laurent Dury received the Grand Prix UNAC 2019 for library music, a nod to his significant contribution to ambient composition and sound design. His career proves his gift for fusing diverse influences into creations that transcend traditional boundaries, making him a key voice in contemporary professional music.
