Modulhater:
Thomas Papay’s career began in the early 2000s. After several years as a DJ with New Wave, Post-Punk and Cold Wave influences, he turned to electronic production, favoring vintage synths and drum machines. Highly active on the industrial/techno scenes with projects Le Diktat and Rope, Thomas was already crafting a dark, uncompromising, cinematic sound. After multiple critically acclaimed albums on labels such as Audiotrauma, Kubernoise, OPN Records and Syrphe, he collaborated with artists like Punish Yourself, Sonic Area and Niveau Zero.
With his new project MODULHATER, Thomas has focused since 2019 on old-school techno inspiration, drawing from EBM, New Beat and Acid. He has performed at venues like Point FMR, Glazart and La Machine du Moulin Rouge, sharing bills with Krikor, Terence Fixmer and Arnaud Rebotini. MODULHATER also teamed up with techno producer Ghost Dance, releasing two standout collaborations (“Malware” and “Structure”) on the prestigious US label Mau5trap (60k YouTube views).
A first album, “Velodrome”, arrived on vinyl via Beatsqueeze Records. International productions quickly picked up his tracks for hit series such as “La luz Mas Oscura”, “Kleo” (Netflix) and “Tokyo Vice” (HBO / CANAL+), led by the now-cult “Gevaert” (42k YouTube views), which earned him a nomination and award at the 2022 Production Music Awards.
2024 marks a comeback for MODULHATER with “ACID BODY MUSIC”, an explosive, punchy album of 10 tracks blending demanding, dark techno with analog electro atmospheres, saluting the pioneers of EBM, rave and acid.
Born in the anxiety of the first lockdown, “ACID BODY MUSIC” emerged as an outlet for enforced stillness. MODULHATER crafted explosive, furious tracks influenced by Acid, EBM and industrial sounds—a rigorous, cathartic analog techno steeped in Detroit pioneers and the late-80s New Beat/EBM vibe. Vintage synths and drum machines roar, hypnotic basslines hit hard, and MODULHATER drags us into a dystopian universe where the strobe-soaked dancefloor is populated by cyborgs.
A lover of Roland TB-303s, MODULHATER channeled his technique into tailor-made melodies.
