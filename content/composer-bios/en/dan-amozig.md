Dan Amozig:
Dan Amozig is a multi-instrumentalist from Amiens, renowned for his command of guitar, bass, trumpet, flugelhorn and vocals. Influenced by jazz greats like Wayne Shorter and Wes Montgomery and hip-hop icons such as Madlib and MF DOOM, Dan has forged a unique style that fuses these worlds.
Starting in the early 2000s he dove into jazz and hip-hop. His talent and versatility took him to Paris in 2010, where he quickly joined multiple projects—hip-hop (Billie Brelok, JP Manova live band, Blanka Flares trio) and jazz (Forswing quartet, Awa, BAP Trio, guitar duo Double Jack). They played major festivals like Rock en Seine, Transmusicales and Francofolies de La Rochelle.
Alongside studio sessions and live shows, Dan has hosted the “Fine Cuts” show on Radio Campus Paris 93.9 FM since 2011, interviewing influential artists. A 2014 graduate of CIM, he also teaches guitar at the Épinay-sur-Seine conservatory, focusing on contemporary music.
Dan keeps enriching the scene with notable contributions: in 2024 he appears on four albums across rap, soul, trip-hop and soundtrack (“Awon & Parental - Sublime”, “Principles of Joy - It’s Soul That Counts”, “N’Zeng - The Trip”, “Yann Kornowicz & Dan Amozig - VIDEOCLUB 2”). With one foot rooted in jazz and the other exploring hip-hop and beyond, Dan Amozig is a true musical trailblazer. His ability to blend influences makes him a standout figure on today’s French scene.
