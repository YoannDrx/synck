Tcheep is a French beatmaker and co-founder of the Mutant Ninja Records label. Passionate about golden-era hip-hop, he creates boom-bap instrumentals packed with soul, jazz and movie samples, making him a key figure on the beatmaking scene. Do you love the dusty grain of old samples? Lo-fi boom bap that follows you everywhere, from the office to the car? Heavy drums that make your head nod? The many-armed producer Tcheep and his legendary SP-404 are the very definition of beatmaking: a subtle art blending groove, smoothness and hip-hop energy. Whether it’s the mysterious Technodrome, the Eastern-flavoured melodies of Oasis Mecanic, the psychedelic Acid Monsters Temple or the chilled beat tapes Futuroscope, Tcheep shines. Both a sample digger and the architect of his own universe built on kicks and snares, he draws from a wide range of influences: East Coast rap, jazz, psychedelic rock, traditional Hungarian music and Indian sitar.
