Of Ivory & Horn:
Dorian Chamoin, better known as Of Ivory & Horn, is a French artist who has built a singular musical universe. His stage name, drawn from Greek mythology and the gates of dreams, mirrors the ethereal, dreamlike quality of his music—rooted in folk yet breaking convention to offer something modern and innovative.
Dorian began music at five, first with classical piano, then violin, before turning to guitar and voice. He studied in various schools and conservatories, but guitar became his primary instrument, with piano still haunting his expression. Influences from composers like Arvo Pärt and Debussy are palpable, notably on his first album, largely made of pieces initially written for piano then masterfully adapted to guitar.
The Of Ivory & Horn project marks a turning point toward more introspective music and away from the sonic extremes of metal he once favored. Acoustic folk and percussive guitar techniques now dominate, letting him craft soundscapes that prize silence as much as resonance.
Behind the name lies a deep concept inspired by Orpheus wandering the limbo—exploring loss, reflection and personal evolution through music. This is more than a musical project; it’s a quest for harmony and melody that invites listeners to lose themselves in a sonic maze, like Orpheus’s search for knowledge and beauty.
On stage, Dorian favors interaction and risk, choosing pure expression through live voice and instrumentation over samples or backing tracks. His commitment to authenticity shows in every performance, seeking meaningful connection with the audience.
His first video clip, shot in stop motion, also shows his dedication to art—pushing traditional media to create a piece that extends his musical world. With artistic collaborations in live performances, such as gallery openings where music meets visual art, Dorian keeps exploring and blending forms of expression.
Winner of the Zoom 2015 prize, Dorian proved his ability to captivate audiences while learning the craft’s rigor and challenges. His journey testifies to constant evolution as an artist, always ready to push his own boundaries to reach new emotional and aesthetic depths.
