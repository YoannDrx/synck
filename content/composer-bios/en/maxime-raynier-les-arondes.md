Maxime Raynier is a French musician and composer active on the surf-rock and instrumental rock scene. As a member of Les Arondes, a key surf-rock band based around Montpellier, he appears on several of the group's releases (Les Arondes, Kahlùa, Kahlùa and other surfer's delights!, L'appel de la musique surf, Play Eleki 14'), in a style clearly influenced by Dick Dale, The Trashmen and The Astronauts. In parallel, he co-writes music within the project Les Cavaliers, notably on the library music album Surf Fiction (Parigo No. 33) released by PARIGO, where he helps shape a cinematic sound world blending surf music, instrumental rock and retro-tinged atmospheres. Also credited on other projects (Les Braqueurs, The Suttles…), Maxime Raynier stands out as one of the discreet yet essential figures of the French surf / instrumental scene, crafting instantly evocative melodies and guitar lines with a strongly "film-like" quality.
