Drixxxé:
After debuting in the late 90s with the French hip-hop group Triptik, Cédric Aubrun (aka Drixxxé) quickly became one of France’s sharpest beatmakers. Beyond Triptik’s acclaimed albums “Microphonorama” and “Tr-303”, he has produced and remixed for artists as varied as Yelle, Lomepal and The Rodeo, and launched the unclassifiable side project McLuvin—blending vintage and futuristic sounds. Teaming up with the irrepressible Gystere, the group released the album “Animal” on Fontana/Mercury in 2012.
From 2013, powered by decades of digging, he dropped his “Sextapes” mixtape series built entirely from soundtracks of the golden age of 70s erotic cinema. They drew press from Nova to Paper Mag, Dangerous Minds, Wax Poetics and Okayplayer.
In parallel, Drixxxé scored several feature films and documentaries for cinema, TV and web. His first solo album arrived in 2020, conceived as the soundtrack to an imaginary film—a synthesis of his lived experience and personal influences, boldly spanning 70s pop, Erik Satie and electronic music.
