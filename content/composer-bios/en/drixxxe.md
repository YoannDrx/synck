After making his discographic debut in the late 1990s with the French hip-hop group Triptik, Cédric Aubrun, aka Drixxxé, quickly established himself as one of the top beatmakers in France. In addition to Triptik’s highly acclaimed albums Microphonorama and TR-303, he has produced and remixed tracks for a wide range of artists including Yelle, Lomepal and The Rodeo, and launched an unclassifiable side project, McLuvin, blending vintage and futuristic sounds. Together with his irrepressible partner Gystere, this new band released an album entitled Animal in 2012 on Fontana/Mercury.From 2013 onwards, drawing on decades of digging, he started a series of mixtapes, the now-famous Sextapes, made entirely from soundtracks of the golden age of 1970s erotic cinema. These mixes earned him coverage in numerous national and international media outlets, from Nova to Paper Magazine, as well as Dangerous Minds, Wax Poetics and Okayplayer.Alongside his recording career, Drixxxé has contributed to several film and documentary soundtracks released in cinemas, as well as scores for television and the web.In 2020, he released his first solo album, conceived as the soundtrack to an imaginary film — a synthesis of all his accumulated experience and his most personal influences, daring to bridge the gap between 70s pop, Erik Satie and electronic music.
