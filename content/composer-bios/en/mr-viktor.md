Mr Viktor is a French DJ, producer and turntablist widely respected on the scratch scene. As a member of the trio 9 O'Clock, alongside DJ Hertz and Aociz, he won the DMC World Team Championship three times in a row (2013, 2014, 2015), cementing the crew's status as an international reference in turntablism. Having cut his teeth in battles since the late '90s, he has developed an extremely precise style that blends scratch, beat juggling and a strong ear for production. Within the Scratch Science ecosystem, he has gone on to perform and record with artists from both rap and electronic music. Moving between technical showcases, filmed performances for DJ brands and communities, and studio work as a producer, Mr Viktor continues to build a career where turntable virtuosity always serves the music, crafting tracks and live shows that speak both to the general audience and to hardcore scratch heads.
