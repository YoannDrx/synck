2080:
2080 is a jovial character who loves performing his synthetic music live in clubs. An atypical composer, his rhythms carry the DNA of our old 8/16-bit consoles and childhood games, evoking the era when Mario Bros and Street Fighter ruled living rooms. He openly cites that influence alongside his first musical love Jean-Michel Jarre, then Orbital, Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, plus Motown and Stax soul from the 60s/70s—a blend that forged a sound sitting between techno and hip-hop. It’s a smart mix of 80s influences, a taste for chiptune and any kind of audio capture, all driven by a desire to craft futuristic music.
His bold, multi-influenced music resonates with both chiptune fans and the broader electronic crowd. 2080 writes electro-chiptune—a mixture of electronic textures, classic analog synths and console chips like the Gameboy or Commodore 64.
A video-game fan and a key figure of France’s indie electronic scene, 2080 pulls you into retro-gaming: think of his standout “My Megadrive” clip (+600k views), his VJ set for dDamage, live shows inside Minecraft, and numerous collaborations with Red Bull, Arte, Canal+ and various game/documentary soundtracks.
He sees video games as an emotional source, erasing the wall between real and virtual. He loves to mash big Moog synths, Doepfer modulars and Gameboys. His sounds come from Juno-106, DX7, Gameboy, Doepfer A100, Oberheim Matrix 6r, Moog Slim Phatty and Minitaur, Commodore 64, TR-808, 909, 707 and CR-78.
At only four he first heard “Popcorn”, convinced Jean-Michel Jarre wrote it (actually Gershon Kingsley on 1969’s “Music to Moog By”). As a teen he kept listening to Jarre Jr., Vangelis, Queen and Pink Floyd, then dove into the raw Thunderdome hardcore compilations, before sliding into Warp’s intricate world.
For years he produced dark, heavy, ambient-leaning tracks with slow tempos and complex rhythms, then decided to express something positive so his music could be pure fun. True to him: colorful, smiling and playful—far from the brooding electronica archetype. 2080 has one goal: “Make simple music that still has meaning.” The result is upbeat, rounded electronic music packed with video-game-tinged sounds (his first passion). A full-on geek who matured his childhood loves for art, music, comics and video games.
