Grand David:
David Rieu, better known as Grand David, is a versatile French artist and accomplished composer active since 2001. Born in Montpellier, he splits his time between Paris and Berlin, pursuing music across an eclectic spectrum. His signature blends vintage and modern elements, reflected in both his gear and his compositions.
With a studio filled with synths, guitars and vocoders, Grand David channels vintage tones while injecting a contemporary edge. Albums like “Disco World” and “Sci-Fi Era” on Cezame showcase his ability to craft varied atmospheres—from disco-era dancefloor cuts to futuristic, cosmic themes.
Beyond his own projects, he has collaborated with artists such as Emma Lamadji, exploring soul and instrumental blends on “Middle of the Night” from the album “Lady & Soul”. These collaborations widen his repertoire and highlight his knack for crossing genres.
He draws inspiration from legends of music and library sound—François de Roubaix, Roger Roger, Raymond Scott—which informs his kitsch yet sophisticated pieces where humor meets finesse. His work spans library music for labels like Zomba Music, Koka Media/BMG Publishing, Telemusic, Encore Merci, Parigo and Cezame Music.
A style that’s clean yet dripping, classy yet carefree, vintage yet modern makes Grand David a key figure in today’s musical landscape, able to captivate a broad audience with his diverse, catchy compositions.
