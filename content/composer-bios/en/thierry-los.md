Thierry Los:
Thierry Los has been a fixture of the French music scene for over 30 years. He made his mark with the bands Dodge Veg-O-Matic and Vegomatic, and collaborated with notable artists like Italian singer Massimo Guadalupi (gold title on FIP in 2006 for “Jazz On The Road”) and singer-actress Clara Galante (known for “La Sirena nella notte”, Laetitia Casta’s slow dance in ARTE’s UNE ILE). He also worked closely with English soul man Myles Sanko, co-writing his first two albums.
Beyond these collaborations, Thierry composed for Haute Couture shows by designer Maurizio Galante, and his music frequently airs on France Télévision across primetime documentaries and TV commercials. Since 2019 he has been a full SACEM member and has contributed heavily to production music since discovering the field in 2000, when Guillaume Albeck commissioned his first album in his favored style: Electro Surf.
Outside music, Thierry is a prize-winning short-film director, vintage car collector (renting them for film shoots and fashion campaigns), and he has tried his hand at modeling and acting—recently appearing in a SUPERPROF TV ad as a guitar teacher playing an old rocker.
