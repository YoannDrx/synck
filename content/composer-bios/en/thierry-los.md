Thierry Los is a seminal figure on the French music scene, active for more than 30 years. He first made his mark with the bands Dodge Veg-O-Matic and Vegomatic, and has collaborated with numerous renowned artists, including Italian singer Massimo Guadalupi, with whom he earned a gold title on FIP in 2006 for “Jazz On The Road”, and Italian actress-singer Clara Galante, known for “La Sirena nella notte”, the steamy slow track performed by Laetitia Casta in ARTE’s series Une Île. He has also worked closely with British soul man Myles Sanko, co-writing his first two albums. Beyond his artistic collaborations, Thierry has composed for Haute Couture runway shows by designer Maurizio Galante, and his music is regularly broadcast on France Télévisions, notably in prime-time documentaries and TV commercials. Since 2019, he has been a full member of SACEM. He has been deeply involved in production music ever since discovering the field in 2000, when Guillaume Albeck commissioned his first album in his favourite style: electro-surf. Outside of music, Thierry Los is an award-winning short-film director and a collector of vintage cars, which he rents out for film shoots and fashion photoshoots. He has also ventured into modelling and acting, most recently appearing in a SUPERPROF TV commercial as a guitar teacher playing the part of an old rocker.
