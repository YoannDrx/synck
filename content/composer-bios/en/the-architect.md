The Architect takes us on a journey across the world and across styles – hip-hop, jazz, electro, soul, funk and more. A passionate vinyl lover and seasoned digger, the turntables have always been his favourite playground. A hyper-productive beatmaker, he is also involved in various side projects such as L’Entourloop and Bloc. The success of his first EP Foundations, released in 2013 and featuring several hits like “Les Pensées” (8M views) and “Dreader Than Dread (ft. Skarra Mucci & L’Entourloop)” (15M views), led to more than 200 shows worldwide and over 35 million streams on digital platforms. Seven years later, The Architect finally returned with his long-awaited new album Une plage sur la lune, released on 12 June 2020 – “a homebody record with a window open to the world”, as he describes it himself. On 30 May 2022, he dropped the single “Tuna Luna”, a sort of outro to his last album, revisiting the lunar theme in an abstract, lo-fi-tinged hip-hop track. A chilled-out tune, “Tuna Luna” sees The Architect invite Celeste, an 18-year-old beatmaker for whom this is a first official release. For the video, he called on Piel, an even younger director – just 12 years old. With “Tuna Luna”, The Architect delivers a beautiful single while shining a light on the next generation.
