After in Paris:
With 1,000+ production-music cues, they approach composing as a conceptual craft, answering primarily audiovisual briefs. Their music spans orchestral comedy, minimalism, jazz, soul and electro. Emotional melodies, energetic and hopeful textures, and love-infused grooves come together to create original works that salute contemplative, piano-led, cinematic music.
The trio programs machines and plays instruments: Claire Michael on sax, flute and vocals; Jean-Michel Vallet on keys; Patrick Chartol on bass and double bass. They build tracks from samples, sound design and vocal snippets lifted from films like John Cassavetes’ “Shadows”, John Huston’s “The Maltese Falcon” and Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane” (plus extracts from Welles’ radio shows). Guests such as Paolo Fresu (trumpet), Dave Liebman (sax) and Christophe Bras (drums) weave into this mostly nocturnal collection—even on fast tempos. Sometimes contemplative, sometimes sweeping, the soundscapes of Time Cycle reveal more mystery, surprise and emotion with each listen.
They also write original works for theater, film and radio branding. On stage, they tour the world’s most iconic venues:
Jazz in Marciac (France), Ouro Preto Jazz Festival and Belo Horizonte (Brazil), Interart Festival de Capivara (Brazil), Baku International Jazz Festival (Azerbaijan), Festival Mimi (Arles), J&B Festival (Istanbul),
Porgy & Bess (Vienna), Casino de Paris, Théâtre Dejazet, Cirque d’Hiver, New Morning, Sunset, Duc des Lombards…
AFTER IN PARIS are seasoned travelers, and their résumés prove it: Jean-Michel Vallet (Serge Gainsbourg, IRCAM, Paco Séry, Karl Zéro…) and Patrick Chartol (MC Solaar, Brooklyn Funk Essentials, Nekropsi…). Claire Michael was voted “revelation of the year” by the Brazilian press, reflecting the instant feedback loop between their music and an international audience.
They have also collaborated with Johnny Hallyday, MC Solaar, Jacques Higelin, Raul de Souza, Didier Lockwood, Paco Séry, Toninho Horta, Caito Marcondes, Ray Lema, William Sheller, Manu Dibango, Sertab Erener (Eurovision winner), Taraf de Haïdouks, Laco Tayfa (Brooklyn Funk Essential / Double Moon), Paolo Fresu, Dave Liebman, Maxime Saury, Steve Lacy, Ziskakan and many more.
Their latest album, a tribute to John Coltrane titled “Trane Steps”, earned high critical praise. These jazz-tinged melodies, crafted with modern tools, simply rekindle the memory of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Jean-Michel Vallet moves between piano and computer with equal ease, Claire Michael plays tenor sax and flute with lightness, and Patrick Chartol anchors the airy repertoire with bass, double bass and keys.
