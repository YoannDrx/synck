Ugly Mac Beer:
Ugly Mac Beer started in the late 90s as DJ for the group La Formule alongside Wax Tailor. In the 2000s, keen to develop his own projects, he launched a solo career.
He quickly became an essential figure of turntablism/scratch music in France—both as an artist and as a prolific indie producer via his label Beatsqueeze Records.
In the mid-2000s he began collaborating with digger/beatmaker Mister Modo. Their chemistry produced a run of projects and many international collaborations with culture heavyweights like MF Grimm, Kool Keith, Psycho Les (Beatnuts), Guilty Simpson, Mike Ladd, El Da Sensei and DJ D-Styles.
The 2009 Modonut album earned strong media exposure and wider success. The soul-tinged track “Not Afraid” (ft. Jessica Fitoussi) received heavy radio play and international airplay. The duo’s second album, simply “Modonut 2”, arrived in 2012 and yielded the hip-hop banger “Diggin in the Crates” (ft. F. Stokes), embraced by DJs across Europe and North America.
More and more in demand for ad and film sync, Ugly Mac Beer discovered a passion for audiovisual work. Lifelong inspired by television, pop culture, cinema and music at large, he has found his place today as a full-time composer for picture.
