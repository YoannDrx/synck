# How streaming platforms pay artists: an overview of business models.

### Business models of streaming platforms

Today's music industry is dominated by streaming, which has introduced new business models for music distribution. As an artist, it's crucial to understand how these platforms work to maximize your return on investment. Let's take a look at these different models.

- Ad-supported free streaming model:\*\* These are platforms like Spotify Free and YouTube where users can access music for free, but are subject to advertising. The money generated by these ads is then redistributed to copyright holders.
- Subscription-based streaming model:\*\* This model is represented by services such as Spotify Premium or Apple Music. Users pay a fixed monthly fee for unlimited, ad-free access to music. Part of this subscription fee is used to pay royalties.
- Some platforms, such as Deezer or Spotify, offer a hybrid model, combining a free, ad-supported service with a premium subscription-based service.

To negotiate your rights effectively, it's important to understand how these business models work and how they impact artist revenues.

> The digital music industry is complex, but by understanding the ins and outs of these business models, you can maximize your earnings and protect your copyrights.

### Calculating royalties per listener

Calculating per-listening royalties is a complex but crucial subject for any artist wishing to understand how their work is financially valued. As a professional in the field with two decades of experience, I'll guide you through the process in the following.

\*\*What is a per-listener royalty?

> A per-listening royalty is the amount paid to a musician or rights owner each time one of his or her songs is listened to. This payment can come from a number of sources, including streaming services, radio stations, or even public venues that play copyrighted music.

Here's how they're usually calculated：

1. _From a percentage:_ This is the most common method. Streaming platforms usually have a fixed royalty rate for each listen, usually a fraction of a cent. To calculate your revenue, you simply multiply this rate by the number of listens.
2. From a flat rate:\_ Some situations, such as public performance rights, may use a flat rate. For example, a venue may pay a flat rate to play your music for a certain period of time.
3. Through rights organizations:\_ Organizations such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM, and SDRM collect royalties on behalf of artists and distribute them according to various factors, including the use of your music.

Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's important to understand how they work to negotiate your royalties effectively.

### Agreements between labels and platforms

Music is a complex and brilliant industry, a delicate union of art and commerce. In this ecosystem, it's important to understand the mechanics of agreements between labels and platforms. So what exactly are "rights assignment agreements" in the music business? And how can they be negotiated effectively? To do this, we need to address a number of points:

- Assignment of rights contracts:\*\* These are contracts where artists grant their label the right to use their work for production, promotion and distribution. In general, these contracts stipulate that the label holds these rights for a given period and in specific territories.
- Negotiation:\*\* The terms of a rights assignment contract can vary widely, depending on the specific needs of the artist and the label. Negotiation is a key element in guaranteeing a fair distribution of revenues generated by the work.
- In today's connected world, many labels partner with streaming platforms to distribute their artists' music. Negotiating these agreements requires an in-depth understanding of market trends and the particularities of the platforms in question.

> As a copyright law professional, I'd like to make it clear that rights assignment agreements are a powerful tool for protecting the interests of artists and labels, but they must be handled with expertise to ensure that all parties benefit from a fair share of the revenue generated by the work.

### The differences between streaming platforms

### Criticism and controversy surrounding streaming platforms

As the popularity of streaming platforms increases dramatically, so does the criticism and controversy surrounding them. To understand this topic in depth, we'll look at the main concerns expressed by artists and the music industry.

- First and foremost, artists' remuneration:\*\* While major record labels sign juicy contracts with streaming platforms, many artists feel dissatisfied with their share of the pie. Did you know, for example, that for an artist to earn minimum wage through Spotify, he or she would need more than 200,000 listens per month?

The current remuneration model for streaming platforms leaves many artists out in the cold," says an anonymous music industry spokesperson.

- Second, transparency:\*\* The precise workings of streaming platform algorithms are often opaque. This can create uncertainty for artists seeking to understand how their music is promoted, or not, on these platforms.
- Third, lack of control:\*\* Artists can feel powerless over the distribution of their music, having little control over where and how their work is distributed.

In conclusion, while streaming platforms have certainly democratized access to music by making it easier to listen to, it's clear that there's still a lot of work to be done to ensure a fairer distribution of revenues and greater control for artists. The challenge for the music industry will be to strike the right balance between the benefits of streaming and respect for artists' rights.

### Tips for maximizing streaming revenues

As an artist, maximizing your streaming revenues can be a key element in your overall success. Here are a few tips to help you achieve this goal:

- **Understand the different streaming platforms:** Each streaming platform offers different rates of pay. It's essential to understand how each platform works in order to maximize your revenue. For example, some platforms pay more for longer listens, while others pay generously for shorter listens.
- **Promote your music:** The more popular and listened-to your music is, the more streaming revenue you'll earn. So get active on social networks, create viral videos, organize contests, sponsor playlists and take part in events to promote your music.
- **Choose a good music distributor:** The distributor of your music can have a significant impact on your revenues. Make sure you choose a distributor who can not only put your music on multiple platforms, but who can also make sure you get paid quickly and fairly.

> It's not enough to put your music on streaming platforms to make money. Maximizing streaming revenue requires an active commitment to promoting your music, understanding the mechanics of each platform and choosing a reliable music distributor.

Above all, it's important to remember that every listen to your music is a chance to earn more income. So keep creating, sharing and promoting your music to maximize your streaming revenues.
